# Simple Python Flask app on Cloud Foundry

This is a (very) simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application that shows how the built-in Python buildpack detection on [Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.org) works.

```
$ cf push myapp-name
```

## Python on Cloud Foundry

* Deploy with `cf push myapp`
* Scale with `cf scale myapp ...`
